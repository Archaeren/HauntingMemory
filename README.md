# Haunting Memory
Spooky themed matching game

Built using [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/tutorial-3-create-a-matching-game). 

The game allows the player to select two tiles and checks if the icons pictured match. If they do, they will remain visible, 
otherwise they will vanish after 0.75 seconds and allow the player to choose another set. When all matches have been made, 
displays a victory message congratulating the player.

## My alterations

- added additional rows 
- changed and increased the number of icons
- modified congratulatory message
- added a timer that tracks seconds passed
- created a check for victory that does not run a loop after every match
